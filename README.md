# **Detailed Project Report: Vehicle Silhouettes Classification**

## **1. Introduction**
This project addresses the task of classifying vehicles (Van, Car, Bus) based on a dataset containing features derived from the silhouettes of the vehicles. The goal is to build a robust machine learning model that can accurately classify these vehicles into their respective categories based on geometric properties.

### **Problem Statement:**
The task involves classifying vehicles into categories such as Van, Car, or Bus based on their geometric silhouettes. This problem is crucial 
for applications in automated traffic systems and vehicle recognition technologies. The challenge lies in leveraging numerical features like compactness, circularity, 
and skewness to identify patterns distinguishing one class from another. Accurate classification
requires a robust machine learning model that understands these subtle differences, enabling reliable predictions and aiding decision-making in real-world scenarios.

## **2. Dataset Overview**
The dataset contains 846 rows and 19 features derived from vehicle silhouettes. Each feature quantifies shape-related attributes, such as compactness (degree of shape compactness), 
circularity (how round the shape is), skewness (asymmetry of the silhouette), and others. The target variable represents the vehicle class: Van, Car, or Bus.
The richness of features provides a multidimensional perspective, but redundant and irrelevant columns pose challenges, making preprocessing critical to ensure meaningful inputs for the model.

### **Data Columns:**
- **Shape-based features:** These features describe the shape and structure of the vehicle's silhouette, such as:
  - `compactness`: Measures the compactness of the shape.
  - `circularity`: Defines how circular the silhouette appears.
  - `skewness`: Provides an understanding of the asymmetry of the silhouette.
  - `hollows`: Measures the number of hollow areas in the silhouette.

## **3. Data Preprocessing**
Data preprocessing transforms raw data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling. For this project, it includes
handling missing values, removing irrelevant features, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. These steps eliminate inconsistencies and ensure the dataset is 
clean, relevant, and normalized, preventing biases in the model. Preprocessing also involves splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

### **Step 1: Handling Missing Values**
Initially, the dataset had some missing values, which were handled by dropping rows that contained these missing values. This was necessary to ensure the model did not encounter issues during training and evaluation.

```python
data.dropna(inplace=True)
```

### **Step 2: Removing Irrelevant Features**
Several columns were found to be irrelevant for the task, either because they contained redundant information or did not contribute meaningfully to classification. These columns were dropped:

```python
irrelevant_columns = ['pr.axis_aspect_ratio', 'max.length_aspect_ratio', 'pr.axis_rectangularity', 'max.length_rectangularity', 'scaled_variance.1', 'elongatedness', 'scaled_radius_of_gyration.1', 'skewness_about.1', 'skewness_about.2']
data.drop(columns=irrelevant_columns, inplace=True)
```

By dropping these, we reduced the dimensionality and removed noise from the dataset, improving the model's focus on the most important features.

### **Step 3: Encoding the Target Variable**
The target variable, `class`, was categorical (Van, Car, Bus), so it was encoded using label encoding. This step converts the text labels into numerical values:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
data['class'] = le.fit_transform(data['class'])
```

Now, the target variable is in a numerical format that can be fed into the machine learning model.

### **Step 4: Feature Scaling**
Since the features vary in magnitude, feature scaling was applied using the `StandardScaler`. This ensures that all features contribute equally to the model, preventing any feature from dominating due to its larger scale.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

### **Step 5: Train-Test Split**
To evaluate the performance of the model, the data was split into a training set and a testing set using a 65-35 ratio. The training set was used to train the model, and the test set was used to evaluate its generalization performance.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.35, random_state=42)
```

## **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA involves exploring the dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies. Visualization tools like heatmaps and pairplots are used to analyze feature correlations and distribution. 
This step helps identify multicollinearity, feature importance, and potential outliers that could impact model performance. 
Insights from EDA guide feature selection and model development strategies. Key steps in EDA include:

- **Correlation Matrix:** A correlation matrix was plotted to identify the relationship between different features and between features and the target variable. This helps to detect highly correlated features, which may lead to multicollinearity.
  
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", fmt=".2f")
plt.show()
```

- **Visualizations:** Distributions and pairplots were generated to inspect the spread of individual features and their relationships.

## **5. Model Development**
### **Step 1: Choice of Model**
The classification model chosen for this task is the **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**, which is a powerful tool for classification tasks, especially when the data is not linearly separable. The SVC algorithm works by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space.

### **Step 2: Model Training**
The SVC model was trained on the preprocessed training data:

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
svc = SVC(kernel='linear')
svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

The linear kernel was chosen as it is well-suited for a high-dimensional dataset with a relatively small number of samples.

---

## **6. Model Evaluation**
### **Step 1: Accuracy**
After training the model, we evaluated its performance on the test set using **accuracy**, which measures the proportion of correct predictions.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
y_pred = svc.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy*100:.2f}%")
```

The model achieved an accuracy of **62.28%**, which indicates moderate performance. This suggests room for improvement, either by exploring more sophisticated models or tuning hyperparameters.

### **Step 2: Confusion Matrix**
The confusion matrix provides a deeper understanding of how well the model is classifying each class. It shows the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="Blues", xticklabels=['Van', 'Car', 'Bus'], yticklabels=['Van', 'Car', 'Bus'])
plt.show()
```

This matrix reveals that the model performs better for certain classes (e.g., **Car**) while struggling with others (e.g., **Van**).

### **Step 3: Classification Report**
The **classification report** provides detailed metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, for each class.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=['Van', 'Car', 'Bus']))
```

This report shows that:
- **Van:** Precision = 0.46, Recall = 0.45, F1-Score = 0.45
- **Car:** Precision = 0.58, Recall = 0.76, F1-Score = 0.66
- **Bus:** Precision = 0.52, Recall = 0.39, F1-Score = 0.45

---

## **7. Results and Conclusion**
The model achieved a reasonable accuracy of **62.28%**. However, the performance is far from optimal, especially for certain classes like **Van** and **Bus**. The confusion matrix and classification report highlight that the model performs well for **Car** but struggles with **Van** and **Bus** classification.

### **Recommendations for Improvement:**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The model could benefit from hyperparameter tuning (e.g., adjusting the `C` and `gamma` parameters in SVC).
- **Advanced Algorithms:** Trying advanced algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost could improve performance, especially when dealing with non-linear relationships.
- **Feature Engineering:** Exploring additional features or transformations, such as polynomial features, could provide more insightful input for the model.
- **Resampling:** Addressing class imbalances (if any) through resampling techniques like SMOTE or undersampling may lead to better result
